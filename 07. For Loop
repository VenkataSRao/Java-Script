For Looph has 3 parts ... those are


loop initialization:
====================
where we initialize our counter to a starting value. The initialization statement is executed before the loop begins.

test statement:
================
which will test if a given condition is true or not. If the condition is true, then the code given inside the loop will be 
executed, otherwise the control will come out of the loop.

iteration:
===========
statement where you can increase or decrease your counter.



syn:
====

for (initialization; test condition; iteration statement){
   Statement(s) to be executed if test condition is true
}
