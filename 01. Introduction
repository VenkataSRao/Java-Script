JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.

Designed for creating network-centric applications.

Complementary to and integrated with Java.

Complementary to and integrated with HTML.

Open and cross-platform


Advantages:
===========

Less server interaction
========================
You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, 
which means less load on your server.

Immediate feedback to the visitors − They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter 
something.

Increased interactivity − You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them 
via the keyboard.

Richer interfaces − You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich 
Interface to your site visitors.

Limitations of JavaScript:
==========================
We cannot treat JavaScript as a full-fledged programming language. It lacks the following important features −

Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has been kept for security reason.

JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no such support available.

JavaScript doesn't have any multithreading or multiprocessor capabilities.

Once again, JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language that allows you to build interactivity into otherwise
static HTML pages.
