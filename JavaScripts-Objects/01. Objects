JavaScript is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language. A programming language can be called object-oriented if it provides
four basic capabilities to developers −

Encapsulation
  the capability to store related information, whether data or methods, together in an object.

Aggregation
  the capability to store one object inside another object.

Inheritance
  the capability of a class to rely upon another class (or number of classes) for some of its properties and methods.

Polymorphism
  the capability to write one function or method that works in a variety of different ways.
