JavaScript is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language. A programming language can be called object-oriented if it provides
four basic capabilities to developers −

Encapsulation
  the capability to store related information, whether data or methods, together in an object.

Aggregation
  the capability to store one object inside another object.

Inheritance
  the capability of a class to rely upon another class (or number of classes) for some of its properties and methods.

Polymorphism
  the capability to write one function or method that works in a variety of different ways.
  
  
Object Properties:
===================
Object properties can be any of the three primitive data types, or any of the abstract data types, such as another object.
Object properties are usually variables that are used internally in the object's methods, but can also be globally visible 
variables that are used throughout the page.


The syntax for adding a property to an object is −

objectName.objectProperty = propertyValue;


Object Methods:
===============
Methods are the functions that let the object do something or let something be done to it. There is a small difference between
a function and a method – at a function is a standalone unit of statements and a method is attached to an object and can be 
referenced by the this keyword.

For example − Following is a simple example to show how to use the write() method of document object to write any content on
the document.

document.write("This is test");

User-Defined Objects:
===============================
All user-defined objects and built-in objects are descendants of an object called Object.

The new Operator
The new operator is used to create an instance of an object. To create an object, the new operator is followed by the 
constructor method.

In the following example, the constructor methods are Object(), Array(), and Date(). These constructors are built-in 
JavaScript functions.

var cust = new Object();
var lan = new Array("C++", "Perl", "Java");
var day = new Date("August 15, 1947");
