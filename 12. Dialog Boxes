Java Script supports 3 types of dialog boxes..

  Alert Dialog box
  Confirmation Dialog box
  Prompt Dialog box
  
  
Alert Dialog box:
=================

An alert dialog box is mostly used to give a warning message to the users. For example, if one input field requires to enter 
some text but the user does not provide any input, then as a part of validation, you can use an alert box to give a warning 
message.


Confirmation Dialog box:
========================

A confirmation dialog box is mostly used to take user's consent on any option. It displays a dialog box with two buttons: Cancel.

If the user clicks on the OK button, the window method confirm() will return true. If the user clicks on the Cancel button, 
then confirm() returns false. You can use a confirmation dialog box as follows.


Prompt Dialog box:
===================

The prompt dialog box is very useful when you want to pop-up a text box to get user input. Thus, it enables you to interact 
with the user. The user needs to fill in the field and then click OK.

This dialog box is displayed using a method called prompt() which takes two parameters: (i) a label which you want to display 
in the text box and (ii) a default string to display in the text box.

This dialog box has two buttons: OK and Cancel. If the user clicks the OK button, the window method prompt() will return the 
entered value from the text box. If the user clicks the Cancel button, the window method prompt() returns null.
