JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page.
When the page loads, it is called an event
When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event.
Other examples include events like pressing any key, closing a window, resizing a window, etc.

Events are a part of the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 and every HTML element contains a set of events which can trigger JavaScript Code.


onclick Event Type:
===================

This is the most frequently used event type which occurs when a user clicks the left button of his mouse. 
You can put your validation, warning etc., against this event type.

Example

<html>
   <head>
      
      <script type="text/javascript">
         <!--
            function sayHello() {
               alert("Hello World")
            }
         //-->
      </script>
      
   </head>
   
   <body>
      <p>Click the following button and see result</p>
      
      <form>
         <input type="button" onclick="sayHello()" value="Say Hello" />
      </form>
      
   </body>
</html>



onsubmit Event type:
=====================

onsubmit is an event that occurs when you try to submit a form. You can put your form validation against this event type.



onmouseover and onmouseout:
====================================

These two event types will help you create nice effects with images or even with text as well. 
The onmouseover event triggers when you bring your mouse over any element and the onmouseout triggers when you move your 
mouse out from that element
