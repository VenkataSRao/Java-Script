While:
======

while loop is to execute a statement or code block repeatedly as long as an expression is true. 
Once the expression becomes false, the loop will terminate

Syntax:

while (expression){
   Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true
}



do... while:
=============

The do...while loop is similar to the while loop except that the condition check happens at the end of the loop. 
Loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false.

syn:

do{
   Statement(s) to be executed;
} while (expression);


Note: semicolon used at the end of the do...while loop
